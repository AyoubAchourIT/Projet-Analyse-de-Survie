Survival Analysis Project with my dear friend Yishu.

# Survival Analysis

This repository contains a survival analysis study conducted using classical statistical methods.

The project focuses on time-to-event modeling and interpretation of censored data.

---

## Objectives

- Understand and implement Kaplan–Meier survival estimation
- Analyze hazard functions and survival probabilities
- Apply Cox proportional hazards models
- Interpret statistical outputs in a modeling context

---

## Methods

The analysis includes:

- Kaplan–Meier estimator
- Log-rank test
- Cox proportional hazards regression
- Model interpretation and discussion of assumptions

---

## Repository Structure

- `analyse_de_survie.ipynb` — main notebook
- Previous versions (`v1–v4`) document the iterative development process

---

## Purpose

This project was developed to strengthen practical understanding of survival modeling techniques in applied statistics.

It emphasizes statistical reasoning, model interpretation, and methodological clarity rather than automation or deployment.
